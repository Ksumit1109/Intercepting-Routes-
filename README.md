# [Next.js Intercepting Routes Modal example](https://nextjs-app-route-interception.vercel.app/)

An example showing Next.js 13's [Intercepting Routes](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/intercepting-routes) feature.

Navigating into the photo page client-side will open a modal instead of a full page, while still updating the URL. Navigating directly into the photo page URL or refreshing the page while the modal is open will bring up the photo page instead.
